# Data Science Projects By Hamza Belel
This portfolio is a collect of projects I have attempted by implementing explorative data analysis and machine learning techniques.

## Kaggle Competitions
### Airbnb New User Bookings
Recruitment competition hosted by Airbnb.This is a regression problem where you predict where a new user will make his or her first booking. Although the competition has ended 4 years ago, I thought it was worthwhile to attempt the problem and submit predictions.General overview and data is available through [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/airbnb-recruiting-new-user-bookings/overview)
### House Prices:Advanced Regression
The House Prices dataset is a knowledge competition provided by kaggle. This is a dataset many people starting out in Data Scicence would have come across. It is a regression problem where we predict the price of a house based on a number of features. A general overview and description of the problem is available through [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques)

## Data Analysis
### Spotify Listening Habits
Interesting mini analysis of what I have been listening to for the past couple years. I discover my favourite podcasts,songs and artist.Libraries used were, seaborn for visual analysis and pandas for data manipulation.
